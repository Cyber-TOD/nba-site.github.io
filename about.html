    <h3>Here are some questions about the NBA.</h3>
    <h4>What is the NBA</h4>
    <p>
      The National Basketball Association, or NBA, is a professional basketball
      league comprised of 30 teams across North America featuring the best
      basketball players in the world.
    </p>
    <h4>How many teams are there in the NBA?</h4>
    <p>
      The National Basketball Association, or NBA, is a professional basketball
      league comprised of 30 teams across North America featuring the best
      basketball players in the world. The NBA is a collection of 30 teams,
      broken down by two conferences with three divisions apiece. The Western
      Conference plays host to the Northwest, Pacific and Southwest Divisions.
      The Eastern Conference’s 15 squads also break up across three divisions:
      the Atlantic, Southeast and Central.
    </p>
    <h4>When was the NBA established?</h4>
    <p>
      The National Basketball Association was founded on June 6, 1946 at the
      Commodore Hotel in New York City. Maurice Podoloff was the league’s first
      president, a title later changed to commissioner. Eleven teams were part
      of that league, originally called the Basketball Association of America.
      Podoloff’s name is now emblazoned on the NBA MVP trophy.
    </p>
    <h4>How many games are there in an NBA season?</h4>
    <p>
      There are 82 games in the NBA’s regular season.
    </p>
    <h4>Who are some of the best players in NBA history?</h4>
    <p>
      The NBA’s list of all-time Legends continues to grow with each new
      generation, boasting names like Michael Jordan, Bill Russell, Kareem
      Abdul-Jabbar, Wilt Chamberlain, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird, Oscar
      Robertson, John Havlicek, Rick Barry, John Stockton, Karl Malone, Elgin
      Baylor, David Robinson, Julius Erving, Charles Barkley and many more.
      Since then, players like LeBron James, Tim Duncan, Kobe Bryant, Kevin
      Garnett, Shaquille O’Neal, Steve Nash, Dirk Nowitzki, Allen Iverson, among
      others, have added their names to the list of greats.
    </p>
    <h4>How many teams make the playoffs?</h4>
    <p>
      The top eight teams in each Conference reach the postseason, with the No.
      1 seed facing No. 8 in the first round, No. 2 vs. No. 7 and so on. Each
      round features a best-of-seven series with a 2-2-1-1-1 format (two games
      at the top seed’s home court, two games at the lower seed’s home, then
      back and forth one game at a time). The winners of each Conference meet in
      the best-of-seven NBA Finals.
    </p>
    <h4>How can I watch NBA games</h4>
    <p>
      Fans can also watch games live and on-demand on NBA LEAGUE PASS around the
      world.
    </p>
    <h4>How are All-Stars selected?</h4>
    <p>
      The starting lineups are selected each year by fans around the world, who
      can vote online at nba.com, the NBA app and on social media. The reserves
      are selected by NBA head coaches. If a player is unable to play due to
      injury, his replacement is selected by NBA Commissioner Adam Silver. If a
      team has a starter who’s unable to play, the head coach of that All-Star
      team will select his replacement from his bench (including any
      Commissioner-appointed players).
    </p>
    <h4>Who coaches the All-Star teams?</h4>
    <p>
      The two spots go to the head coaches of the teams with the best record in
      each Conference at the time of All-Star weekend.
    </p>
    <h4>When is the NBA Draft?</h4>
    <p>
      The NBA Draft is held each year near the end of June, after NBA Finals.
    </p>
    <h4>Who’s eligible to be Drafted?</h4>
    <p>
      The pool of players includes all players over the age of 19 who are more
      than a year removed from high school, and who have also officially
      declared for the NBA Draft; all international players over the age of 22;
      all players over 19 who’ve signed a contract to play with an international
      professional team; and all US-born players who’ve played their four years
      of college eligibility.
    </p>
    <h4>How does the Draft order and Draft Lottery work?</h4>
    <p>
      Each spring, a lottery — comprised of ping-pong balls drawn randomly in an
      audited event — decides the fate of the 14 teams who did not qualify for
      the Playoffs. The teams with the fewest wins have the greatest chance at
      winning the Lottery. Three Lotto balls are drawn, deciding the first,
      second and third picks. After that point, the remaining picks go
      sequentially, in order of lowest finish to highest finish in the
      standings. After pick No. 14, the teams choose in reverse order of regular
      season finish (the team with the best record goes last). Teams may move up
      and down in the order with trades.
    </p>
    <h4>How many players are on a NBA roster?</h4>
    <p>
      Each NBA team can have a maximum of 15 players, 13 of which can be active
      each game.
    </p>
    <h4>How long are the quarters?</h4>
    <p>
      Each quarter lasts 12 minutes. Each overtime lasts 5.
    </p>
    <h4>How long is the shot clock?</h4>
    <p>
      The shot clock is 24 seconds. Starting in the 2018-19 season, the shot
      clock will reset to 14 seconds on offensive rebounds.
